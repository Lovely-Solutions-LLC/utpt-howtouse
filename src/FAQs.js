          <h4>What counts as an 'activity'?</h4>
          <p>
            An 'activity' in our app is any entry in the 'board-level' activity logs. There are a few redundant activity types (something that would cause double counting) that are fitered out of the calculations.

          <h4>Can I change the board and user configuartion after initial setup?</h4>
          <p>
            Yes, by navigating to the 'settings' gear in the top right of the app, you can use the "Reconfigure" button to update the board/user configuration of the app.

          <h4>Is there a limit to how many boards I can track?</h4>
          <p>
            Yes, there's a limit to the number of boards you can track. This value will be dependent on the plan you have. The trial period allows for up to 6 boards, and the free plan allows for up to 2.

          <h4>Do dashboard settings or widget filters apply to the app?</h4>
          <p>
            No, our app operates independently of the dashboard settings and widget filters. Boards that are connected to a dashboard with our app on it do not affect the app's configuration.
